## Forgot the Environment File - API Connection Issues

Every project should have a `.env` file associated with it. You can find these files stored [as described here](new-projects#create-an-env-file). If you don't have a `.env` file, you will get confusing errors when trying to connect to an API because you will be missing your `client_id` or other important information. To get the `.env` file in your project, check the [`Nerevu Group Dropbox`](new-projects#create-an-env-file) for one and create a symbolic link to it. If you don't find one in Dropbox, [create one and add it to Dropbox](new-projects#create-an-env-file).
