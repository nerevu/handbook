## Recording Time

### Timely

* [Getting Started with Timely](https://support.timelyapp.com/en/collections/76502-getting-started)

Timely uses the 2 general concepts to organize completed tasks: `Projects` and `Tags`. `Projects` can be generally grouped into two categories: `Internal` and `Client`.

- `Internal` projects are assigned to the `Nerevu` client and is work that is not tied to a direct client, but is necessary to company operations (checking mail, meetings, general learning, etc.)
- `Client` projects are assigned to an individual client, and is work that is directly related to a client project (developing features, reviewing code, etc.).

Similarly, `Tags` come in two categories: `Billable` and `Non-Billable`....

When inputting hours worked, tags should be applied to every task we do, whether internal or external, as well as a simple description of the work we did.

*NOTE: When using the `learning` tag, the work is general in nature unrelated to a specific project (e.g., functional programming), please use the `Internal` project. However, if the learning is in relation to a specific project you are working on (e.g., Flask Admin), please use that client project instead of `Internal`.*
